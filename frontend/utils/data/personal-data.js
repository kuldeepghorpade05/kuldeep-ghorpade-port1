  description: "I’m Kuldeep Ghorpade, a passionate and self-driven Backend Engineer with a strong interest in Cloud Computing, Networking, DevOps, and Systems Troubleshooting. I’m a quick learner who enjoys exploring new technologies and solving complex problems at scale. My primary expertise lies in backend development using Java and Python, along with designing scalable APIs, debugging distributed systems, and working with cloud infrastructure. I enjoy turning noisy logs into actionable insights, building log-parsing and monitoring pipelines, and reducing incident resolution time through effective debugging and runtime analysis. I’m deeply interested in reverse engineering, protocol analysis, and log investigation, and I actively contribute to open source by sharing tools, automation, and learnings that help teams diagnose issues faster. I’m open to opportunities that align with my skills and curiosity in backend systems, cloud, and networking.",
